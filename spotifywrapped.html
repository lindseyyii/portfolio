                    This project was split into two sprints (1st sprint: user authentication, implementing Spotify's API, front-end designs; 2nd sprint: connecting front-end and back-end, profile management system, responsive UI across various resolution sizes). We used tools like Google Calendar, Trello, and Discord for team coordination.
                    Each sprint began with a planning meeting, and we would stay accountable and troubleshoot problems as a team with semi-weekly updates Discord channel.

                    We used Figma to create detailed wireframes and user flows, followed by prototypes that reflected the Spotify's branding and functionality. The front-end developers focused on making the design visually appealing while ensuring it worked across different screen sizes.
                    Bright colors and abstract shapes were incorporated to give a modern and electric feel while enhance visual engagement.

                    The main challenge came with user authentication, as we had to integrate Spotify’s API for unique user profiles. We overcame this by working collaboratively and refining our user authentication flow.
                    Each user story was broken into smaller tasks, and code reviews were essential for maintaining quality and ensuring progress. Collaborating and supporting each other helped keep the project on track.

                    Throughout the project, we ensured testing was continuous, using Git branches for testing new features and avoiding conflicts. Testing was done iteratively, allowing us to catch and fix bugs early, which was critical for smooth deployment.
