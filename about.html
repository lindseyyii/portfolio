        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div style="margin: 0 50px">
            <h4>My story begins in my early high-school days, when lectures would get occasionally boring, and I’d pick up a pen. When there weren’t any papers around to scribble on, my hand would become the victim of my boredom. The little doodles born from my Statistics class bloomed into a love for calligraphy and art. Soon after, I graduated from my hand and was gifted with my now-beloved iPad Pro. By experimenting with Procreate on my iPad, I discovered a new world of possibilities along with a passion for digital art, and it only took off from there. </h4>
            <h4>When beginning my first year of college, I took a beginner Python class. Having the presumption that my brain was wired on the artistic side, I had no expectations nor interest to venture into such a technical field. I proved myself wrong when I learned coding was a similar process to art. Although the learning curve was a bit more challenging, it was also a creative outlet, a form of storytelling, and (ironically) a new, literal language through which I could communicate. I discovered a different way to create something out of nothing, finding joy in designing elegant algorithms, much like sketching the first lines of a drawing. Coding has taught me that creativity knows no bounds and that even the most logical structures can possess beauty and narrative. Here marked the beginning of another passion.</h4>
            <h4>Over my journey, I have realized that drawing holds multiple meanings to me. It’s a language, a creative outlet, and a form of storytelling. It gives me the ability to capture a scene and tell an introduction to a story, letting the viewer interpret the ending for themselves through their lens. Despite my short-lived attention span, drawing is one of the few things that brings me into deep focus. This is because, with every piece I have created and will create, I learn something new, whether it’s discovering a new combination of colors, the intricacy of shadows and highlights of a hand, or an appreciation of the delicate and beautiful relationship between humans and the world. </h4>
            <h4>Drawing and coding are a reflection of my evolving style and my endless curiosity about creating. I hope to explore the endless possibilities where these two passions intersect. I am thrilled to share it with you and hope it resonates with you as deeply as it does with me. Thank you for joining me on this creative adventure. Welcome to my world of art and coding!</h4>
