    <h1 style="margin-top: 15vh;">About Me</h1>
        <div style="margin: 50px 150px 50px 150px;">
            <h4desc>My story begins with my beloved iPad Pro. By experimenting with drawing and rendering tools, I discovered a new world of possibilities along with a passion for digital art. Over my journey, I have realized that graphic design holds multiple meanings to me. It’s a language, a creative outlet, and a form of storytelling. It gives me the ability to capture a scene and tell an introduction to a story, letting the viewer interpret the ending for themselves through their lenses.
                <br><br>After a few beginner coding classes, I learned coding was a similar process to art. Although the learning curve was a bit more challenging, it was a new creative outlet, a form of storytelling, and (ironically) a new, literal language through which I could communicate. I discovered a different way to create something out of nothing, finding joy in designing elegant algorithms, much like sketching the first lines of a drawing. Coding has taught me that creativity knows no bounds and that even the most logical structures can possess beauty and narrative. Here marked the beginning of another passion.
                <br><br>The combination of coding and visual design is a reflection of my evolving style and my endless curiosity. I hope to explore the endless possibilities where these two passions intersect. I am thrilled to share it with you and hope it resonates with you as deeply as it does with me. Thank you for joining me on this creative adventure. Welcome to my world of art and coding!
