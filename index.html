            <h1>Hi, I'm Lindsey! Welcome to My Portfolio.</h1>
            <p>Computational Media Student with a real passion for design; striving to create innovative solutions and diverse perspectives to optimize UI and product outcomes.</p>
            <p>I’m an aspiring UI/UX designer studying Computational Media (with a concentration in People/Interaction Design) at Georgia Tech. My passion in this thread started in my high-school's Literary Magazine, The Muse, operating as the Graphic Design Editor-in-Chief. 
                <br>From there, I developed a wide range of skills and created a variety in projects using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Indesign, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and Weebly. Now, I hope to combine my programming skills in Python and Java to delve into the tech landscape and bring my designs to life. </p>
